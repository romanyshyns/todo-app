## Project Overview

This Todo App provides users with an intuitive and efficient way to manage their tasks. Users can easily add, edit, or delete tasks to stay organized and track their progress. Each task displays essential details, such as a title and optional due date, ensuring clarity and focus.

For enhanced user experience, the app supports task filtering by status (e.g., active, completed), enabling users to focus on what matters most.
